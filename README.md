# Response-Generator
This program will generate a letter of recommendation for the student. The name of the student will be entered by the user and will replace strings that act as placeholders. The user will also select whether the letter will be a positive or negative letter of recommendation. Based on that, random adjectives (positive or negative) will replace some adjectives in the original letter so that there is some uniqueness to each letter.
